## Inspiration
The inspiration behind Feed Our World is to address the food crisis in the world, which has been worsened by disasters, war, climate change, and pandemics. We also address the US sustainable goal 2: Zero Hunger. The archaic food supply chain system causes excess waste and inefficiency. The supply chain is highly affected and there is no application present today that can help consumers donate their food to needy people. Thereby to make a disruptive change, we introduce "Feed Our World" which uses fantom blockchain to resolve these issues and make this world hunger-free.

## What it does
Feed Our World is a decentralized blockchain and Dapp-based solution that connects producers and consumers through an on-demand system. By streamlining the food acquisition process, reducing middlemen, and using blockchain technology to track food more efficiently, Feed Our World aims to put control of the food chain into the peopleâ€™s hands, creating an On-Demand system and ushering in an era of food prosperity for all.

## How we built it
We built it using HTML, CSS, TypeScript, Solidity, Hardhat and Fantom Blockchain. Feed Our World allows donors to track their donations and ensure that their contributions are being used for the intended purposes. The platform also enables transparency and accountability by leveraging the power of the Fantom blockchain to record all transactions and donations securely.

## Challenges we ran into
One of the major challenges faced by the team was integrating the Fantom blockchain into the platform. We had to learn how to use blockchain technology and overcome the technical difficulties associated with it.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
The team is proud of the fact that we were able to develop a decentralized platform that is secure, transparent, and user-friendly. We also feel proud to have leveraged the power of the Fantom blockchain to achieve our goals.

## What we learned
The team learned a lot about blockchain technology and its potential for revolutionizing charitable giving. We also learned about the challenges associated with integrating blockchain into a web platform and the importance of user experience.

## What's next for Feed Our World
The team plans to continue developing the platform and expand its reach. We aim to partner with more charities and organizations to make the platform even more impactful. We also plan to add more features and capabilities to the platform to make it even more user-friendly and efficient.
